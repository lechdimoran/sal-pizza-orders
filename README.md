# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### API Configuration

This app connects to a web API that uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.

**Environment Variables:**
- `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL`: Your API base URL
- `REACT_APP_API_KEY`: (Optional) API key for non-authenticated endpoints

**Authentication Flow:**
1. User logs in with username/password
2. API returns a JWT token
3. Token is stored locally and sent with all subsequent requests
4. Token is included in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header

**Security Note:** JWT tokens are stored in localStorage. For enhanced security, consider implementing token refresh logic and secure token storage.

### Authentication

This app includes user authentication to secure access:

- **Login Page**: Users must log in with valid credentials to access the application
- **Protected Routes**: All application routes are protected and require authentication
- **Session Management**: User sessions are maintained in localStorage
- **Automatic Logout**: Users can log out manually via the header

**Backend Requirements**: The authentication system expects your API to have:
- `POST /auth/login` endpoint that accepts `{ username, password }` and returns `{ user, token }`

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
